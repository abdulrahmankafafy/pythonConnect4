This is a Python implementation of the Connect Four game using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The code defines a 6x7 game board and two players, a human player (represented by 1) and an AI agent (represented by 2). The AI agent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move to make in order to win the game.

The create_board() function initializes the game board as a 6x7 numpy array filled with zeros. The drop_piece() function places a player's piece on the board in the specified row and column. The is_valid_location() function checks if a column is not full, i.e., if the top row in that column is empty. The get_next_open_row() function returns the next available row in the specified column. The print_board() function prints the current state of the game board. The winning_move() function checks if a player has won the game.

The minimax() function is the implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. It takes the current state of the game board, the current depth, alpha, beta, and the maximizing player as input. If the depth is 0 or if either player has won the game, the function returns the score and column as None. If the maximizing player is playing, the function determines the best move for the AI agent by recursively calling itself with the new state of the board, the decreased depth, and the opposite of the maximizing player. If the minimizing player is playing, the function determines the best move for the human player by recursively calling itself with the new state of the board, the decreased depth, and the opposite of the maximizing player.

The play_game() function initializes the game board and starts the game. It alternates between the human player and the AI agent until the game is over. The human player's move is determined by random choice while the AI agent's move is determined by the minimax algorithm.

Overall, this code provides a simple yet effective implementation of the Connect Four game using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make the AI agent's moves more efficient and effective.
