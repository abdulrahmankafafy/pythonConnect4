# pythonConnect4
a Python implementation of the Connect4 game using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The code defines a 6x7 game board and two players, a human player (represented by 1) and an AI agent (represented by 2). The AI agent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move to make in order to win the game.
